# Incluud

Incluud is an initiative by [@markteekman](https://github.com/markteekman) and [@peterpadberg](https://github.com/peterpadberg) with a shared mission:
To create accessible, user-friendly, and inclusive digital experiences for everyone.

## ‚ú® What We Do

At Incluud, we believe accessibility isn‚Äôt just a feature‚Äîit‚Äôs a foundation. Our work focuses on:
- **Promoting Accessibility**: Advocating for accessibility as a core principle in all projects.
- **Building Inclusive Tools**: Developing resources, components, and solutions that prioritize universal design.
- **Collaboration and Education**: Working with the community to share knowledge and encourage best practices.

## üöÄ Current Projects

We‚Äôre currently contributing to:
- [Accessible Astro Starter](https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-starter): A fully accessible boilerplate for kickstarting Astro projects, with Tailwind CSS support.
- [Accessible Astro Components](https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-components/): A library of reusable, accessible components designed for Astro, build in TypeScript.
- [Accessible Astro Dashboard](https://github.com/markteekman/accessible-astro-dashboard/): A user-friendly dashboard interface with a login screen, built with accessibility in mind.

## ‚ôø Our Vision

Incluud is more than a development initiative; it‚Äôs a commitment to a more inclusive web. Through innovation and collaboration, we aim to make accessibility standard practice‚Äîbenefiting developers, designers, and users alike.
